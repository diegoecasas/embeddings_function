# embeddings_function
embedding function using OpenAI API to use when needed

Text is mapped onto a multidimensional vector space.
The numbers outputted by the model are the text's. 
Semantically similar texts are embedded more closely in the vector space.
Measuring distance allows us to measure similarity.
Similar words appear closer to get her location in the space. 
Dissimilar words appear further away.

Embeddings allow semantic meaning to be captured 
Semantic meaning: context and intent behind text.

Enables embeddings applications: 
-Semantic search

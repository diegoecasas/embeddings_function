embedding function to use when needed

Text is mapped onto a multidimensional vector space The numbers outputted by the model are the text's. Semantically similar texts are embedded mor e cl osel y in the vector space Measuring distance allows us to measure similarity Enables embeddings applications: Semantic search Recommendations Classification location in the space Similar words appear closer to get her Dissimilar words appear further away, Embeddings allow semantic meaning to be captured Semantic meaning: context and intent behind text.
